This project tries to predicts the solar energy for ookalhama station using 98 mesonet points using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost & ANN. Further prediction enhansed by using CNN-1D
using Attension Mechanism and apply XAI techniques to explain the predictions by Models.
